# 🚀 Claude Code Demo Repository

Hey there! 👋 This is a demo repo I put together to showcase what you can build with Claude Code - Anthropic's AI coding assistant. Pretty cool stuff!

## ✨ What's Inside

This repo has examples across multiple languages to show off different capabilities:

### 📜 PowerShell (`backup-script.ps1`)
A fully-functional backup automation script with error handling and timestamped backups. Perfect for Windows sysadmin tasks!

### 🐍 Python (`data-processor.py`)
Data processing utility that demonstrates:
- CSV/JSON parsing and transformation
- Statistical analysis
- Clean OOP patterns
- Export functionality

### 🌐 Web (`index.html`)
A beautiful, responsive demo page with:
- Gradient styling 🎨
- Smooth animations
- Interactive JavaScript
- Modern CSS practices

### ⚙️ Node.js (`task-manager.js`)
Full-featured CLI task manager that shows off:
- Command-line argument parsing
- File system operations
- JSON data persistence
- Professional CLI UX

## 🎯 Why This Matters

I created this to demonstrate how AI-assisted development can help you:
- ⚡ Build faster across multiple languages
- 📝 Write well-documented, production-ready code
- 🔄 Automate repetitive tasks
- 🎓 Learn new languages and frameworks

## 🛠️ Try It Out

Each script is ready to run! Just clone the repo and:

```bash
# PowerShell backup
pwsh backup-script.ps1 -SourcePath "./data" -DestinationPath "./backups"

# Python data processor
python3 data-processor.py

# Task manager CLI
node task-manager.js add "Check out this awesome repo"
```
